This notebook creates a dashboard wireframe in Python using the fifa_eda.csv dataset.
The goal is to apply visual design concepts and data storytelling through multiple charts:

Heatmap of correlations among numeric variables.

Scatter plot of Age vs Overall with correlation calculation.

Top 20 clubs by number of players.

Height vs Skill Moves by preferred foot panels.

Highlighting emerging stars (young players with high potential).
